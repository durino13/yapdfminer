# yapdfminer (Yet Another PDFMiner fork)

PDFMiner is a great Python tool that had apparently been abandoned by its original author
[Yusuke Shinyama](https://github.com/euske) in 2016.
Ever since, it got forked and re-forked time and time again but never maintained for long.

## Goals

I created this fork in order to apply some pull requests that languish on the original repository that would solve
some bugs that I ran into in my own work.

This fork is targeting Python 3.7.
There will be no attempt to maintain backwards compatibility to older versions of Python.

At the moment I can make no promise to be a better maintainer than my predecessors. Caveat emptor.

**Lineage:**
- This is a fork of [gwk/pdfminer3](https://github.com/gwk/pdfminer3/).
- gwk/pdfminer3 was forked from [pdfminer/pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six)
- pdfminer.six was forked from the original [pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer)
